# Resume Application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is from [The odin project's JavaScript course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/javascript/lessons/cv-application). The main goal is to practise the basic concepts I have learned of React.

The application is a small tool to create a simple curriculum vitae. It has 3 sections, personal information, educational information and practical information:

- Personal Information includes full name, location where you are currently living and contact info.
- Eduational Information consist of a list. Each item has a period of time, the title of study and the school name.
- Practical Information also consist of a list. Each item has a period of time, the position on the company, the main task you are/were responsable of and the company's name.
